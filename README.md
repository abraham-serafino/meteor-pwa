# Meteor Booklist as a Progressive Web App

## Getting started

To start the server in dev mode:

```bash
npm i -g meteor
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000

To build and launch a production-ready docker container with bundled MongoDB instance (requires Docker):

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:80

## Highlights

This project shows how MeteorJS can be used to create Progressive Web Apps, which can be installed for offline use
on desktops or  mobile devices. Take a look at the following files and folders for example code:

* `public/`
* `client/main.html`
* `imports/client.js`
* `.meteor/packages` (notice the addition of the force-ssl Meteor package)
